Title: [What Can Unsupervised Machine Translation Contribute to High-Resource Language Pairs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15818)

> Whereas existing literature on unsupervised machine translation (MT) focuses on exploiting unsupervised techniques for low-resource language pairs where bilingual training data is scare or unavailable, we investigate whether unsupervised MT can also improve translation quality of high-resource language pairs where sufficient bitext does exist. We compare the style of correct translations generated by either supervised or unsupervised MT and find that the unsupervised output is less monotonic and more natural than supervised output. We demonstrate a way to combine the benefits of unsupervised and supervised MT into a single system, resulting in better human evaluation of quality and fluency. Our results open the door to discussions about the potential contributions of unsupervised MT in high-resource settings, and how supervised and unsupervised systems might be mutually-beneficial.

Title: [Mixed Cross Entropy Loss for Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15880)

> In neural machine translation, cross entropy (CE) is the standard loss function in two training methods of auto-regressive models, i.e., teacher forcing and scheduled sampling. In this paper, we propose mixed cross entropy loss (mixed CE) as a substitute for CE in both training approaches. In teacher forcing, the model trained with CE regards the translation problem as a one-to-one mapping process, while in mixed CE this process can be relaxed to one-to-many. In scheduled sampling, we show that mixed CE has the potential to encourage the training and testing behaviours to be similar to each other, more effectively mitigating the exposure bias problem. We demonstrate the superiority of mixed CE over CE on several machine translation datasets, WMT'16 Ro-En, WMT'16 Ru-En, and WMT'14 En-De in both teacher forcing and scheduled sampling setups. Furthermore, in WMT'14 En-De, we also find mixed CE consistently outperforms CE on a multi-reference set as well as a challenging paraphrased reference set. We also found the model trained with mixed CE is able to provide a better probability distribution defined over the translation output space.

Title: [Cross-lingual alignments of ELMo contextual embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15986)

Authors: [Matej Ulčar](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Ulčar%2C+M), [Marko Robnik-Šikonja](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Robnik-Šikonja%2C+M)

> Building machine learning prediction models for a specific NLP task requires sufficient training data, which can be difficult to obtain for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual embeddings map word embeddings from a low-resource language to a high-resource language so that a prediction model trained on data from the high-resource language can also be used in the low-resource language. To produce cross-lingual mappings of recent contextual embeddings, anchor points between the embedding spaces have to be words in the same context. We address this issue with a new method for creating datasets for cross-lingual contextual alignments. Based on that, we propose novel cross-lingual mapping methods for ELMo embeddings. Our linear mapping methods use existing vecmap and MUSE alignments on contextual ELMo embeddings. Our new nonlinear ELMoGAN mapping method is based on GANs and does not assume isomorphic embedding spaces. We evaluate the proposed mapping methods on nine languages, using two downstream tasks, NER and dependency parsing. The ELMoGAN method performs well on the NER task, with low cross-lingual loss compared to direct training on some languages. In the dependency parsing, linear alignment variants are more successful.

Title: [ChineseBERT: Chinese Pretraining Enhanced by Glyph and Pinyin Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16038)

> Recent pretraining models in Chinese neglect two important aspects specific to the Chinese language: glyph and pinyin, which carry significant syntax and semantic information for language understanding. In this work, we propose ChineseBERT, which incorporates both the {\it glyph} and {\it pinyin} information of Chinese characters into language model pretraining. The glyph embedding is obtained based on different fonts of a Chinese character, being able to capture character semantics from the visual features, and the pinyin embedding characterizes the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which handles the highly prevalent heteronym phenomenon in Chinese (the same character has different pronunciations with different meanings). Pretrained on large-scale unlabeled Chinese corpus, the proposed ChineseBERT model yields significant performance boost over baseline models with fewer training steps. The porpsoed model achieves new SOTA performances on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks, including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, text classification, sentence pair matching, and competitive performances in named entity recognition. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at [this https URL](https://github.com/ShannonAI/ChineseBert).

> This paper describes the submission to the IWSLT 2021 Low-Resource Speech Translation Shared Task by IMS team. We utilize state-of-the-art models combined with several data augmentation, multi-task and transfer learning approaches for the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) steps of our cascaded system. Moreover, we also explore the feasibility of a full end-to-end speech translation (ST) model in the case of very constrained amount of ground truth labeled data. Our best system achieves the best performance among all submitted systems for Congolese Swahili to English and French with BLEU scores 7.7 and 13.7 respectively, and the second best result for Coastal Swahili to English with BLEU score 14.9.

> In this paper, we introduce ELECTRA-style tasks to cross-lingual language model pre-training. Specifically, we present two pre-training tasks, namely multilingual replaced token detection, and translation replaced token detection. Besides, we pretrain the model, named as XLM-E, on both multilingual and parallel corpora. Our model outperforms the baseline models on various cross-lingual understanding tasks with much less computation cost. Moreover, analysis shows that XLM-E tends to obtain better cross-lingual transferability.

> Transformers have become a standard architecture for many NLP problems. This has motivated theoretically analyzing their capabilities as models of language, in order to understand what makes them successful, and what their potential weaknesses might be. Recent work has shown that transformers with hard attention are quite limited in capacity, and in fact can be simulated by constant-depth circuits. However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption, which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers. In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a saturated transformer memory vector is O(logn), which implies saturated transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer's effective circuit depth by a factor of O(logn).
